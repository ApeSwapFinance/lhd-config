## Deployment Example

In that example, we'll add our native token BANANA to the repo! We'll need to go `src > constants` folder and open `addresMappingWhitelist.ts`. And you'll notice skeleton of code block looks like that:

```typescript
{
    tokenSymbol: '',
    tokenName: '',
    tokenLogoUrl: '',
    tokenAddresses: [
      { address: '', chainId: '' },
      { address: '', chainId: '' },
    ],
    knownOwners: [
      '',
      '',
      '',
    ],
},
```

Once you finish filling, it should look like that:

```typescript
 {
    tokenSymbol: 'BANANA',
    tokenName: 'ApeSwap BANANA',
    tokenLogoUrl: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ApeSwapFinance/apeswap-token-lists/main/assets/BANANA.svg',
    tokenAddresses: [
      { address: '0x603c7f932ed1fc6575303d8fb018fdcbb0f39a95', chainId: '56' },
      { address: '0xd978f8489e1245568704407a479a71fcce2afe8f', chainId: '42161' },
    ],
    knownOwners: [
      '0x944694417a6ca0a70963d644a11d42c10e3af042',
      '0xabd7853b79e488bc1bd9e238a870167b074eb714',
      '0x71c0c1001520e1568e17836cc8a19d0dbdb2bd5f',
    ],
  },
```

**Be Aware Of Those Importnat Details:**

`tokenSymbol` has to be always uppercase.

All contract addresses should be lowercase at contract address needed variables such as `tokenAddresses`, `knownOwners`.

`knownOwners` should be a known liquidity holder wallet of the project. That can be a Safe multi-sig, locking contract, or other owned wallet. We will verify these!

Please don't forget to use `Prettier` before comitting your code.

Once you finish the code, run `yarn configure` to convert your TypeScript entry into a consumable JSON file and create a new pull request in our main repository.

And finally, please make sure to add `project-requests` label to your PR for making tracking progrees easier for us.
